# STKYFNGRS

Thanks for checking out my repo. I'm a programming hobbyist with interests in graphic design and photography. I'm an analyst for a living but in 2021 Ethereum caught my attention and since then computing and programming have taken over my time. After hundreds of hours of tutorials and experimentation I'm building this website to showcase my various creative outlets.

The code in this repo is hosted on a regular web hosting service that runs about $2 a month. The nameservers are managed by a free cloudflare account and the compiling of my next.js app is done through a free vercel account. NFT images and metadata are hosted on IPFS with Pinata as the pinning service. The NFTs themselves are ERC-721 and the coin is an ERC-20.

Feel free to fork this code and make it your own.
