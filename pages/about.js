          Welcome to my website! My name is Alex and I live in Southern
          California. A bit about me, I am a happy husband and father of two,
          who works as an analyst. My passions for technology and creativity
          extends to various hobbies, such as PC building, programming,
          photography and digital art. The Learn tab at the top will have some
          links I found interesting regarding web3, crypto and development. The
          Mint page is a simple NFT minting app I built for the pieces I'd like
          to get onto the blockchain. These are mostly photographs from the past
          20 years mixed with some digital art I created. The mint will end when
          2000 pieces have been minted.
