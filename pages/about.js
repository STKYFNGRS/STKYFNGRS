          Welcome to my website! My name is Alex and I live in Southern
          California. A bit about me, I am a happy husband and father of two,
          who works as an analyst. My passions for technology and creativity
          extends to various hobbies, such as PC building, programming,
          photography and digital art. The Learn tab at the top will have some
          links I found interesting and helpful regarding web3, crypto and
          development. When I got interested in Ethereum in 2021 I had never ran
          a command prompt, used powershell or done anything technical for that
          matter and the information in these links were instrumental on my web3
          journey. The Mint page is a simple NFT minting dapp I built for the
          pieces of my art I'd like to get onto the blockchain. This is a 10k
          collection comprised of a generative collection I created with a few
          hundred of my favorite photographs that I've taken over the years.
          Thanks for stopping by, I hope you enjoy!
