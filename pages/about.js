        <p>
          I am a dedicated father of two and a loving husband, with a passion
          for working as an analyst. My passion for technology and creativity
          extends to various hobbies, such as PC building, programming,
          photography, and digital art. I am a self-taught programmer, and I am
          currently learning how to use next.js and solidity. It is my goal to
          become a full-stack web3 developer.
